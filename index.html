			üíé I am confident that the hiring manager and recruiter, who is reading this right now, is noticing my passion and efforts for data analytics and my hard work over the years in tech. My mentors and mentees worldwide continously remind me that it was not easy and still is highly competitive to get into the prestigious companies that I have have the pleasure to work for: EY, Oracle, Expedia, and Domino Data Lab. I was loan staff to help with a well-known transportation company's IPO in 2019 which is now a household name. Not everyone's career is linear and companies go through downsizing during a pandemic and recession which are both outside of my control. The breath of knowledge and experience I bring to any team and company should outweigh these economic roadblocks. Now let's move forward and join me in exploring and analyzing our data sets below!
