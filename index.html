	         <div class="body-text"><br>üìç**Addressing the 2021 & 2022 resume gaps: <br><br>üí° One of my philosophy in life is second chances.  ‚ÄúYou cannot define a person on just one thing. You can‚Äôt just forget all these wonderful and good things that a person has done because one thing didn‚Äôt come off the way you thought it should come off.‚Äù 
~ Aretha Franklin<br><br>The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an eventual global company restructuring of Expedia (travel slowed for 2 years) and subsidiaries in Sep 2021. The impact was that the company restructured my team and I was unfortunately unable to relocate to Austin, TX to join my team. <br><br>After Expedia, I took the initiative to upskill by working part-time, while looking for my next FT role, at a French Bakery which helped me be more detail-oriented and further improved my people and project management skills in a fast-paced environment. <br>
		<br>In Nov. 2022, economic downturn/recession unfortunately impacted 25% of Domino Data Lab, a Series F Enterprise Machine Learning Ops platform's workforce (RIF Layoff/company downsizing). <br>
		<br> Despite uncontrollable factors, as a data analyst, my skills and experience remain intact, as evidenced by the exceptional recommendations displayed on my LinkedIn profile. My years of experience have endowed me with transferable people skills, emotional intelligence, and cross-border communication abilities with F500 multinational teams, all of which remain highly relevant and valuable. <br><br>I am always curious and a life time learner. I am continously looking for ways to upskill and have learned Qlik Sense, SnowflakeDB, GitHub, Google Analytics, and Canva last 2 months. I now have my own Etsy store which provides me direct experience w/ product analytics, SEO, product design, and marketing. 
			 

	<div class="body-text">
		<br><br>
			üíé I am confident that the hiring manager and recruiter, who is reading this right now, is noticing my passion and efforts for data analytics and my hard work over the years in tech. My mentors and mentees worldwide continously remind me that it was not easy and still is highly competitive to get into the prestigious companies that I have have the pleasure to work for: EY, Oracle, Expedia, and Domino Data Lab. I was loan staff to help with a well-known transportation company's IPO in 2019 which is now a household name. Not everyone's career is linear and companies go through downsizing during a pandemic and recession which are both outside of my control. The breath of knowledge and experience I bring to any team and company should outweigh these roadblocks. Now let's move forward and join me in exploring and analyzing our data sets below!
