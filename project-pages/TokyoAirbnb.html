		   <div class="subheader-text">Intro</div>
        <div class="body-text"> In Nov. 2022, I visited Tokyo, Japan after 7 years! The trip inspired this dashboard. My first ever trip to Japan was in 2015. It was my very first solo travel ever. Back then I was able to secure various Airbnbs for ~$55-$75 per night in various districts of Tokyo & later also Osaka. After I was impacted by workforce reduction at Domino Data Lab in early November, I decided to do a last minute trip to Tokyo. Borders reopened for tourists in October, initially for travelers traveling w/in tour groups only and later for all in the US and certain Asian countries like Hong Kong and Taiwan.

          <div class="body-text">As an experienced data analyst, I conducted a quantitative analysis of the quarterly sales data for four types of croissants at a French bakery using Tableau. The French Bakery Croissant Sales Insights - 2022 Qtrly dashboard showcases a range of visualizations and analyses based on the data, including:

<ul>
  <li>Total quarterly sales: The total sales for the quarter was $138,245.95.</li>
  <li>Croissant type breakdown: Regular croissants had the highest sales, contributing 47.2% of the total sales, followed by chocolate croissants (26.9%), almond croissants (17.3%), and chocolate almond croissants (8.6%).</li>
  <li>Sales by day of the week: Fridays had the highest sales ($26,649.61), followed by Thursdays ($26,460.54), and Saturdays ($25,473.64).</li>
  <li>Sales by hour of the day: The hours between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM had the highest sales, contributing 24.6% of the total sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these insights, the bakery can make data-driven decisions regarding product offerings, marketing strategies, and inventory management to improve its overall performance and profitability. For example, the bakery may consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offering promotions on regular and chocolate croissants on Thursdays and Fridays, as those days had the highest sales.</li>
  <li>Increasing their inventory of regular croissants during peak sales hours in the morning to meet customer demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the French Bakery Croissant Sales Insights - 2022 Qtrly project showcases my expertise in quantitative analysis, data visualization, and my ability to turn complex data sets into clear and actionable insights for businesses.</p></div>
