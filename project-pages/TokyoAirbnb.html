If we were to potentially start a side hustle there in Tokyo for passive income, Airbnb would be a grand idea. Plus, we can stay there when we do go and visit! Let's start off with exploring the public dataset from 2022 provided to us from Inside Airbnb. </div>

    <p>I am thrilled to share my Airbnb data analysis with you, which was inspired by my recent trip to Tokyo, Japan in November 2022 - my first visit in 7 years! When I first traveled to Japan in 2015, it was my very first solo trip and I was lucky to have stayed with such welcoming Airbnb hosts. I was able to secure various Airbnbs for just $55-$75 per night in different districts of Tokyo, and later in Osaka as well. My Osaka host even left me snacks and local pamphlets of tourist attractions in English. Borders had reopened for tourists in October, and I was able to travel from the US and ranked up to Top 5% of Google Local Guides.</p>

    <p>Originally, I was going to use 2019 Tokyo Airbnb dataset I found on Kaggle but then Excel has issues with CSV files that contains international language data. So the problem was occuring during the importing of the CSV file because by default, it doesn't support UTF-8 data. https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/help/opening-csv-files-containing-international-language-data/index.html I was able to find a workaround after some research. Opened Excel and then loaded the data in UTF-8 and comma format. This worked! Next in order to proceed to converting CSV to SQL, I downloaded Notepad++ and added the "CSV Lint" plug-in for Notepad++ via https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint/. I was able to successfully convert the CSV to SQL.</p>

However, I gave importing the 2022 Tokyo Airbnb Excel file a try and it worked too! So I proceeded to analyze the more recent data. Next, I encountered an error when trying to query from the Airbnb database despite a few refreshes. After restarting SSMS, I was able to query the data.

 Okutama, Komae, Edogawa, Kodaira, and Shinagawa have the highest average price per day for their listings, respectively $166,000,  $134,445,  $42,146,  $37,106, and $34,700.
Learned: realized SSMS doesn’t support Limit so did some research and used Top 5 instead.

     When it comes to type of the property at Airbnb, it seems to be renting out the entire place comes first such as entire rental unit and entire home with 4,836 and 1,004 units. Then, room in hotel seems to be the next popular option with 706 units. It came to a surprise to me that hotels are listed on Airbnb too.

		      I extracted the table into Excel, used a pivot table to check the top 5 districts with the most popular airbnbs.<br>
As for the SQL query, the intention was to confirm that the listings are up-to-date by checking for a review within the past year. Additionally, I wanted to exclude any properties that are already booked for the next year due to extreme popularity with potential yearly agreements. 

 <br><br>After reviewing the list, it appears that Shinjuku is the most popular with 103 listings, followed by Toshima, Shibuya, Sumida, and Taito areas. I’ve never personally heard of Toshima or stayed in that area during my 3 trips to Japan so that was a surprised.

<br><br><b>It would be valuable to examine these listings to identify the unique features that contribute to their high occupancy rates. By incorporating similar strategies, one could maximize revenue by creating a similar listing.</b>

<br><br><b> 4)	What is the monthly revenue generated by the highest-earning Airbnb hosts in Tokyo?</b><br> <br>

                </div>
		      <br>
As part of the first business analysis, I aimed to estimate the potential revenue that could be generated through an Airbnb operation. To accomplish this, I computed the monthly revenue for the most frequently booked listings in Tokyo. Specifically, I multiplied the nightly price by the number of nights booked in a month. To ensure accuracy, I excluded any listings that were fully booked for the year, as these may be reserved due to high demand on a yearly basis.

Shinjuku, Taito, and Sumida Ku have the highest concentration of superhosts. However, it is crucial not to solely target these areas for cleaning services as they likely have established reputations for maintaining clean accommodations.
