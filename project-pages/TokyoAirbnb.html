        <div class="main-title">Tokyo Airbnb (2022) Data Analysis using SQL</div>
		   <div class="subheader-text">Intro</div>
        <div class="body-text"> In Nov. 2022, I visited Tokyo, Japan after 7 years! The trip inspired this dashboard. My first ever trip to Japan was in 2015. It was my very first solo travel ever. Back then I was able to secure various Airbnbs for ~$55-$75 per night in various districts of Tokyo & later also Osaka. After I was impacted by workforce reduction at Domino Data Lab in early November, I decided to do a last minute trip to Tokyo. Borders reopened for tourists in October, initially for travelers traveling w/in tour groups only and later for all in the US and certain Asian countries like Hong Kong and Taiwan.

        <div class="project-details-content"> Issues converting Excel into SQL to load into SQL server: 
		   <div class="body-text">Excel has issues with CSV files that contains international language data. So the problem was occuring during the importing of the CSV file because by default, it doesn't support UTF-8 data. https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/help/opening-csv-files-containing-international-language-data/index.html I was able to find a workaround after some research. Opened Excel and then loaded the data in UTF-8 and comma format. This worked! Next in order to proceed to converting CSV to SQL, I downloaded Notepad++ and added the "CSV Lint" plug-in for Notepad++ via https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint/. I was able to successfully convert the CSV to SQL. </div>

SSMS: SSMS 2022 has an error importing data so after some digging, I was able to uninstall SSMS 2022 to SSMS 2019 and was able to import the SQL file. Next, I encountered an error when trying to query from the airbnb database despite a few refreshes. After restarting SSMS, I was able to query the data. </div>

<ul>
  <li>Total quarterly sales: The total sales for the quarter was $138,245.95.</li>
  <li>Croissant type breakdown: Regular croissants had the highest sales, contributing 47.2% of the total sales, followed by chocolate croissants (26.9%), almond croissants (17.3%), and chocolate almond croissants (8.6%).</li>
  <li>Sales by day of the week: Fridays had the highest sales ($26,649.61), followed by Thursdays ($26,460.54), and Saturdays ($25,473.64).</li>
  <li>Sales by hour of the day: The hours between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM had the highest sales, contributing 24.6% of the total sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these insights, the bakery can make data-driven decisions regarding product offerings, marketing strategies, and inventory management to improve its overall performance and profitability. For example, the bakery may consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offering promotions on regular and chocolate croissants on Thursdays and Fridays, as those days had the highest sales.</li>
  <li>Increasing their inventory of regular croissants during peak sales hours in the morning to meet customer demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the French Bakery Croissant Sales Insights - 2022 Qtrly project showcases my expertise in quantitative analysis, data visualization, and my ability to turn complex data sets into clear and actionable insights for businesses.</p></div>
